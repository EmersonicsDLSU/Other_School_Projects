This is one of the games that my team won the "best game" in a game jam. The game is made in Unity and the platform is 3D and the shader used is URP. The game theme is "What Home Means To You?"(in relevance to the Global Game Jam's Theme in 2019) and the genre is "casual". The game mechanic is simple, the player is set in his/her house that is found along the mountains and there is a burglar that wants to barge inside your house. The house possible entrances like the main door, windows, and balcony are protected with a high-tech security system, but it is being deteriorated by the burglar so the player will need to consistently fix the system by holding the fix button on each entrance location. The game gets progressively harder every minute so it has an ending to the player's skill. The game has a high score feature that drives the player to play more and beat the high score.
