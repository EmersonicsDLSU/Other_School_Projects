In this game, Iâ€™ve used Unity as my platform and choose 2D as the graphical representation. In this game, we implemented an AI functionality that uses a "minimax" algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game will only need one player to play and the opposing player would be the AI agent. The game mechanics is still the same as the original, only the AI feature is implemented.
