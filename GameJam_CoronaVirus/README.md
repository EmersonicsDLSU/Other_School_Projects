The game was set in a 2D platform and was made in Unity. The game lets you play as the covid virus that has the mechanic to move in an omnidirectional direction. You are a virus that is placed in an open environment and needs to infect healthy people and destroy its immune system. After the infection, the virus will be placed inside the person's body and will show the game's platformer stage in a random dungeon map where the player needs to avoid the white blood cells and destroy the person's core health.
