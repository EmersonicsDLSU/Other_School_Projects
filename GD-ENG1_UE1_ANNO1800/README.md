This program is a simulation of Annoâ€™s supply-chain management system. The game techniques use a structure list for the list of items and for the order queues. The objects spawn were implemented with the "object pooling" method and the AI was implemented in the moving trucks that evaluate which object should be delivered/received first to attain efficiency in transporting goods.
