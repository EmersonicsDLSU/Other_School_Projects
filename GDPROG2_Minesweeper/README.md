This program is the recreation of the classic "Minesweeper" game using C language in Dev C++. The game mechanics implemented were still similar to the original game, but I added a few features like creating your own board where the player can assign where the bombs should be placed, can save recent progress in the game(automatic saving), can creating a set of minesweeper boards that varies in size, and a high score mechanic. In this work, I was awarded as the best Minesweeper recreation in my class.
